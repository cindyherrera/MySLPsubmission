For my assignement, in order to copy a file from a different user I put in this command
cp/home/cumoja1\HungerGames /home/cherrera8/Submissions

and this made a copy of Hunger Games to my folder in Submission


Then, I searched and replaced the name Peeta with my name with this command

	sed -i '/s/Peeta/Cindy/g HungerGames'


Finally, to rename the file name I used this command
	mv HungerGames My\Hunger\Games
